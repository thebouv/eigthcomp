# eigthcomp
Just a file to describe my personal comp for Warhammer 40k 8th Edition. This is a work in progress.

These are not meant to be hard, unbreakable rules, but just a general idea I use when building lists for 40k.  Similar to how I self-controlled my lists in 7th edition, but writing them down now.  For specific scenarios or fluffy reasons any of these could be broken, but in general I'll stick to these limits.

* No more than 3 units of any Troop.
* No more than 2 units of any other non-vehicle model
* No more than 1 squadron of 3 vehicles of same type, or 2 individual vehicles of same type. 
    * Example: 1 squadron of 3 Leman Russ Punishers, OR, 2 Punishers not squadroned.
* No limit on Dedicated Transports, but a definite limit on transports of other types (see above limit on vehicles).
* No more than 1 Super Heavy
* Limited named characters.  1? 2?  Unsure what I feel about this yet in 8th.
